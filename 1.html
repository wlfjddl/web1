  <h1>CORONA VIRUS</h1>
  <h5>Good Friday to you and welcome to CNN 10.</h5> We`re happy to watching as we wrap up the week. I`m Carl
  Azuz and I work at the CNN Center in more normal times but everyone`s having to make adjustments in this
  era of <u><strong>corona virus</strong></u> and that includes U.S. politicians.
  <p style="margin-top:20px;"><img src="corona.jpg"width="500"></p>
  <p style="margin-top:20px;">As one political organizer put it, no one`s ever run a campaign completely online before. The big town hall events, the speeches in front of cheering crowds, these
  have been put on hold to keep people from gathering in large groups. So this is turning into a very different
  looking election year than America has ever seen. The once numerous field of presidential candidates has been
  whittled down.
